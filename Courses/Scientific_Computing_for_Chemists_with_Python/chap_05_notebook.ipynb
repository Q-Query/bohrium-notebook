Data columns and rows can contain human-readable labels that are used to access the data. Pandas still supports accessing data using indices if the user wishes to go that route, but the user can now access data without knowing which column it is in as long as the user knows the column label.\n    \nBy popular convention, the pandas library is imported with the `pd alias`, which is used here.

The key difference between the a Series and DataFrame is that a Series is one-dimensional while a DataFrame is two-dimensional. Unlike a NumPy array, pandas objects have fixed dimensionality.

This function imports text files where lines represent rows and the data in each row is separated by characters or spaces. The user can designate what character(s) separate the data by using the `delimiter` or `sep` arguments (they do the same thing),  or as an easy way of breaking up data based on spaces, set the  `delim_whitespaces` equal to `True`. The function also includes a series of other arguments listed below in Table 3.\n\n**Table 3** More `pd.read_table()` Arguments\n\n| Argument | Description |\n|:--------:| :-------    |\n|`delimiter`| Data separator; default is tab|\n|`sep` | Data separator; default is tab|\n|`skiprows` | Number of rows in file to skip before reading data|\n|`skipfooter` | Number of rows at the bottom of the file to skip|\n|`skip_blank_lines`| If `True`, skips blank lines in file; default is `False`|\n|`header` | Row number to use for a data header; also accepts None if no header is provided in the file|\n|`delim_whitespace` | Boolean argument indicating that data is separated by white space; default is `False`|\n|`skipinitialspace` | If `True`, skips white space after delimiter|\n\nAs an example, we can use this function to read a calculated PDB file of benzene and extract the $xyz$ coordinates for each atom. This particular file type, shown below, is [strictly formatted based on the position in a line](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format), but being that all the data columns here have spaces between them, we can use space delimitation by setting  `delim_whitespace=True`. Because the data do not start until the third line and we do not need the last thirteen lines of the file, we should exclude these rows. We set `header=None` because we do not want the function to treat the first line of data as a header or data label.\n\n    HEADER \n    REMARK \n    HETATM    1  H   UNK  0001       0.000   0.000  -0.020 \n    HETATM    2  C   UNK  0001       0.000   0.000   1.067 \n    HETATM    3  C   UNK  0001       0.000   0.000   3.857 \n    HETATM    4  C   UNK  0001       0.000  -1.208   1.764 \n    HETATM    5  C   UNK  0001       0.000   1.208   1.764 \n    HETATM    6  C   UNK  0001       0.000   1.208   3.159 \n    HETATM    7  C   UNK  0001       0.000  -1.208   3.159 \n    HETATM    8  H   UNK  0001       0.000  -2.149   1.221 \n    HETATM    9  H   UNK  0001       0.000   2.149   1.221 \n    HETATM   10  H   UNK  0001       0.000   2.149   3.703 \n    HETATM   11  H   UNK  0001       0.000  -2.149   3.703 \n    HETATM   12  H   UNK  0001       0.000   0.000   4.943 \n    CONECT    1    2 \n    CONECT    2    1    5    4 \n    CONECT    3    6    7   12 \n    CONECT    4    7    2    8 \n    CONECT    5    2    6    9 \n    CONECT    6    5    3   10 \n    CONECT    7    3    4   11 \n    CONECT    8    4 \n    CONECT    9    5 \n    CONECT   10    6 \n    CONECT   11    7 \n    CONECT   12    3 \n    END","metadata":{},"id":"f11a704d-e354-4440-90d4-96ea4fd28570"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os \nos.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = 'http://ga.dp.tech:8118'\nos.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://ga.dp.tech:8118'","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"ceb412db-ec0e-4bee-b430-d1483f440e8b"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"benz = pd.read_table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weisscharlesj/SciCompforChemists/master/notebooks/chapter_05/data/benzene.pdb', delim_whitespace=True, \n                     skiprows=2, skipfooter=13, header=None, \n                     engine='python')","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"c0d567b7-dcac-4fc1-b069-c641687dbef4"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"benz","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"476acb3d-5c2f-4e28-97cf-9d593c825998"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" The $x$, $y$, and $z$ data are in columns 5, 6, and 7, respectively and can be extracted by indexing as discussed in [section 5.1.2](5.1.2).","metadata":{},"id":"66b68ed0-e92e-4531-8bf1-ef49e09226f6"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### 5.2.2 Comma Separated Values Files\n\nPandas provides a collection of more format-specific functions for reading/writing files.

If a nonexistent column is called and assigned values, instead of returning an error, pandas creates a new column with the given name and populates it with the data. For example, the `elements` DataFrame below does not contain a carbon column, so the column is added when assigned to a Series with the data.

Pandas provides the `drop()` method for this purpose. It requires the name of the column or row to be dropped, and by default, it assumes a row, `axis=0`, is to be dropped. If you want to drop a column, change the axis using the `axis=1` argument.

This is commonly used to remove incomplete data from a data set. The `pd.dropna()` function behaves very similarily to the `pd.drop()` function including the `inplace=` and `axis=` arguments.","metadata":{},"id":"bb8f8569-5814-40f9-b1a7-10f099de69c5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### 5.4.4 Merge\n\n```{index} single: DataFrame; merge\n```\n\nTo merge multiple DataFrames, pandas provides a `merge()` method. Similar to above, the `merge()` function will properly align data, but because DataFrames have multiple columns and index values to choose from, the `merge()` function can align data based on any of these values. The default behavior for `merge()` is to check for common columns between the two DataFrames and align the data based on those columns.
