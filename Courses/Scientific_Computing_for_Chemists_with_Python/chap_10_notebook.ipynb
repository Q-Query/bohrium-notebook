It is often the first plotting library a Python user will learn, and for good reason. It is stable, well supported, and there are few plots that matplotlib cannot generate. Despite its popularity, there are some drawbacks... namely, it can be quite verbose. That is, you may be able to generate nearly any plot, but it will take at least a few lines of code if not dozens to create and customize your figure.\n","\n","One attractive alternative is the seaborn plotting library. While seaborn cannot generate the same variety of plots as matplotlib, it is good at generating a few common plots that people use regularly, and here is the key detailâ€¦ it often does what would take matplotlib 10+ lines of code in only one or two lines. To make things even better, seaborn is built on top of matplotlib. This means that if you are not completely happy with what seaborn creates, you can fine tune it with the same matplotlib commands you already know! In addition, seaborn is designed to work closely with the pandas library. For example, think of all the lines of code you have typed to simply add labels to your *x*- and *y*-axes. Instead, seaborn often pulls the labels from the DataFrame column headers. Again, if you do not like this default behavior, you can still override it with `plt.xlabel()` and other commands that you already know.\n","\n","By convention, seaborn is imported with the `sns` alias, but being that this is a relatively young library, it is unclear how strong this convention is. The [official seaborn website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) uses it, so we will as well. All code in this chapter assumes the following import."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"cfdcbbe1-f0ab-4e7e-8a30-22d44744427d","metadata":{"tags":["remove-output"]},"outputs":[],"source":["import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54392c08-ee05-42f0-ae7e-7af9d0b11f97","metadata":{},"source":["## 10.1 Seaborn Plot Types\n","\n","A map of the seaborn plotting library is mainly a series of the different types of plots that it can generate. Below is table of the main categories. The rest of this chapter is a more in-depth survey of select plotting functions, and it is certainly not a complete list.\n","\n","**Table 1** Seaborn Plotting Type Categories Covered Herein\n","\n","| Category | Description |\n","| :-----:  | :---------  | \n","|Regression | Draws a regression line through the data |\n","|Categorical | Plots frequency versus a category |\n","|Distribution | Plots frequency versus a continuous value |\n","|Matrix | Displays the data as a colored grid |\n","|Relational | Visualizes the relationship between two continuous variables |\n","\n","One distinction between some of the plotting categories above is whether they display continuous versus discrete/categorial information. When data are continuous, they can be nearly any value in a range like the density of a metal. This in contrast to discrete or categorial data that places data in a limited number of groups or bins such as the element(s) present in a metal sample.\n","\n","## 10.2 Regression Plots\n","\n","Generating a regression line through data is a common task in science, and seaborn includes multiple plotting types that perform this task. All of the plots discussed below use a least square best fit and include a confidence interval for the regression line as a shaded region. Remember that there is uncertainty in both the slope and *y*-intercept for a regression line. If we were to plot all the possible variations of the regression line within the slope and intercept uncertainties, we get the regression confidence interval. By default, seaborn displays the 95% confidence interval, but this can be changed.\n","\n","### 10.2.1 regplot\n","\n","```{index} single: plotting; regression plot\n","```\n","```{index} single: regression; regression plot\n","```\n","\n","The `regplot` generates a single scatter plot of data with a linear regression through the data points complete with a 95% confidence interval. The `sns.regplot()` function can take `x` and `y` positional arguments just like `plt.plot()`, but it also can take the *x* and *y* column names from a pandas DataFrame. Both approaches are demonstrated below.

For example, the 75 percentile line is where 75% of the data points are below. The 50 percentile is also known as the median. The length of the box (i.e., from 25 percentile to 75 percentile) is known as the *inner quartile range (IQR)*.  Beyond the box are the bars known as *whiskers* which mark the range of the rest of the data points up to 1.5x the IQR.
