So much so that NumPy is even included in Apple's default installation of Python and in other Python-powered applications such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). While it may be tempting to work with NumPy's objects as lists or to circumnavigate the NumPy library altogether, the time it takes to learn NumPy's powerful features is well worth it! It will often allow you to solve problems with less effort and time and with shorter and faster-executing code. This is due to:\n\n- NumPy automatically propagating operations to all values in an array instead of requiring for loops\n\n- A massive collection of functions for working with numerical data\n\n- Many of NumPy's functions are Python-wrapped C code making them run faster\n    \nThe NumPy package can be imported by `import numpy`, but the scientific Python community has developed an unofficial, but strong, convention of importing NumPy using the `np` alias. It is a matter of personal preference whether to use the alias or not, but it is strongly encouraged for consistency with the rest of the community. Instead of `numpy.function()`, the function is then called by the shorter `np.function()`. All of the NumPy code in this and subsequent chapters assumes the following import.","metadata":{},"id":"d9d8abf8-127d-4351-99cf-39b18caece02"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"8a966cfa-71a4-4e7e-bb8c-4a4a6343650b"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.1 NumPy Arrays\n\n```{index} arrays\n```\n\nOne of the main contributions of NumPy is the *ndarray* (i.e., \"n-dimensional array\"), *NumPy array*, or just *array* for short. This is an object similar to a list or nested list of lists except that mathematical operations and NumPy functions automatically propagate to each element instead of requiring a `for` loop to iterate over it. Because of their power and convenience, arrays are the default object type for any operation performed with NumPy and many scientific libraries that are built on NumPy (e.g., [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](5), [scikit-learn](12), etc...).\n\n### 4.1.1 Basic Arrays\n\nThe NumPy array looks like a Python list wrapped in `array()`. It is an iterable object, so you *could* iterate over it using a `for` loop if you really want to. However, because NumPy automatically propagates operations through the array, `for` loops are typically unnecessary. For example, let us say you want to multiply a list of numbers by 2. Doing this with a list would likely look like the following.","metadata":{},"id":"673de40d-1e88-4f12-a4a9-6a02343fbe3a"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nfor value in nums:\n    print(2 * value)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"8ac80d8f-1690-42c6-a8dd-dc82e1ea1e9d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In contrast, performing this same operation using a NumPy array only requires multiplying the array by 2.","metadata":{},"id":"62bf1db1-84b8-4fc6-84d4-f3fa8e9778d5"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\nprint(2 * arr)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"0d4d3362-bda3-41fb-a101-b7ab8580878f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1.2 Type Conversion to Arrays\n\nThere are three common ways to generate a NumPy array that we will cover in the beginning of this chapter.

There are two common functions in NumPy for this task: `np.arange()` and `np.linspace()`. The `np.arange()` function behaves similarly to the native Python `range()` function with the key difference that it outputs an array. Another minor difference is that while `range()` generates a range object, `np.arange()` generates a sequences of values immediately. The arguments for `np.arange()` are similar to that of Python's `range()` function where start is inclusive and stop is exclusive, but unlike `range()`, the step size for `np.arange()` does not need to be an integer value.\n\n~~~python\nnp.arange(start, stop, step)\n~~~\n\nThe `np.linspace()` function is related to `np.arange()` except that instead of defining the sequence based on step size, it generates a sequence based on how many evenly distributed points to generate in the given span of numbers. Additionally, `np.arange()` excludes the stop values while `np.linspace()` includes it. The difference between these two functions is somewhat subtle, and the use of one over the other often comes down to user preference or convenience. \n\n~~~python\nnp.linspace(start, stop, number of points)\n~~~","metadata":{},"id":"e83dec1b-cbf3-46ee-838c-2136df60de3b"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"arr = np.arange(0, 10, 0.5)\narr","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"3dd70ed6-2a88-40a1-ac90-b7d354799fcd"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"arr = np.linspace(0,10, 20)\narr","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"53c95b92-3e52-4be1-91b6-8d9c95d67cb1"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Two other useful functions for generating arrays are `np.zeros()` and `np.ones()` which generate arrays populated with exclusively zeros and ones, respectively.

In broadcasting, the one of the dimensions of the two arrays must be either identical or one-dimensional, otherwise nothing happens except an error message. To deal with the different dimensions, NumPy clones the array with fewer dimensions out so that it has the same dimensions as the other array. It should be noted that NumPy does not really clone out the array in the background; it behavior acts as if it does. It is a convenient way of thinking about the behavior and results. For example, below is the addition between a 2$\\times$2 and a 1$\\times$2 array. \n\n$$  \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{array} \\right] +  \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 2 \\end{array} \\right]= ? $$\n\nTo make the two arrays the same size, the smaller array is cloned along the smaller dimension until the two arrays are the same size as shown below.

Though these are largly analogous functions in terms of capabilities, there is a key difference in that `np.genfromtxt()` can handle missing data while `np.loadtxt()` cannot. This means if your data set may contain gaps, you should use `np.genfromtxt()`.\n\nIn the event the data file contains a gap, the `np.genfromtxt()` function will place a `nan` in that loacation by default.
