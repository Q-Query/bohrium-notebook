To make sure the model does not cheat, it gets an attention mask that will prevent it to access the tokens after token i when trying to predict the token i+1 in the sentence.\n\n![Widget inference representing the causal language modeling task](images/causal_language_modeling.png)\n\n- Masked language modeling: the model has to predict some tokens that are masked in the input.
