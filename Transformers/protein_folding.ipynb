Unlike other protein folding models, it does not require external databases or search tools to predict structures, and is up to 60X faster as a result.\n\nThe port to the HuggingFace `transformers` library is even easier to use, as we've removed the dependency on tools like `openfold` - once you `pip install transformers`, you're ready to use this model! \n\nNote that all the code that follows will be running the model **locally**, rather than calling an external API. This means that no rate limiting applies here - you can predict as many structures as your computer can handle. \n\nIn testing, we found that ESMFold needs about 16-24GB of GPU memory to run well, depending on protein length.
