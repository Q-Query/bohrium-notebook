If that sentence feels a bit intimidating to you, don't panic - there's [a blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-learning-with-proteins) that explains the concepts here in much more detail.\n\nThe specific model we're going to use is ESM-2, which is the state-of-the-art protein language model at the time of writing (November 2022). The citation for this model is [Lin et al, 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v1).\n\nThere are several ESM-2 checkpoints with differing model sizes. Larger models will generally have better accuracy, but they require more GPU memory and will take much longer to train. The available ESM-2 checkpoints (at time of writing) are:\n\n| Checkpoint name | Num layers | Num parameters |\n|------------------------------|----|----------|\n| `esm2_t48_15B_UR50D`         | 48 | 15B     |\n| `esm2_t36_3B_UR50D`          | 36 | 3B      | \n| `esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`        | 33 | 650M    | \n| `esm2_t30_150M_UR50D`        | 30 | 150M    | \n| `esm2_t12_35M_UR50D`         | 12 | 35M     | \n| `esm2_t6_8M_UR50D`           | 6  | 8M      | \n\nNote that the larger checkpoints may be very difficult to train without a large cloud GPU like an A100 or H100, and the largest 15B parameter checkpoint will probably be impossible to train on **any** single GPU! Also, note that memory usage for attention during training will scale as `O(batch_size * num_layers * seq_len^2)`, so larger models on long sequences will use quite a lot of memory! We will use the `esm2_t12_35M_UR50D` checkpoint for this notebook, which should train on any Colab instance or modern GPU.","metadata":{},"id":"1d81db83"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_checkpoint = \"facebook/esm2_t12_35M_UR50D\"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"32e605a2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Sequence classification","metadata":{},"id":"a8e6ac19"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One of the most common tasks you can perform with a language model is **sequence classification**.

The categories will just be integers, with 0 representing the first category, 1 representing the second and so on. In other words, if `sequences[i]` is a protein sequence then `labels[i]` should be its corresponding category. These will form the **training data** we're going to use to teach the model the task we want it to do.\n\nIf you're adapting this notebook for your own use, this will probably be the main section you want to change!

Note also that UniProt annotates residues starting from 1 (unlike Python, which starts from 0), and region annotations are inclusive (so 1..3 means residues 1, 2 and 3). To turn these into Python slices, we subtract 1 from the start of each annotation, but not the end.","metadata":{},"id":"4457b1a0"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\n\ndef build_labels(sequence, strands, helices):\n    # Start with all 0s\n    labels = np.zeros(len(sequence), dtype=np.int64)\n    \n    if isinstance(helices, float): # Indicates missing (NaN)\n        found_helices = []\n    else:\n        found_helices = re.findall(helix_re, helices)\n    for helix_start, helix_end in found_helices:\n        helix_start = int(helix_start) - 1\n        helix_end = int(helix_end)\n        assert helix_end <= len(sequence)\n        labels[helix_start: helix_end] = 1  # Helix category\n    \n    if isinstance(strands, float): # Indicates missing (NaN)\n        found_strands = []\n    else:\n        found_strands = re.findall(strand_re, strands)\n    for strand_start, strand_end in found_strands:\n        strand_start = int(strand_start) - 1\n        strand_end = int(strand_end)\n        assert strand_end <= len(sequence)\n        labels[strand_start: strand_end] = 2  # Strand category\n    return labels","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"a4c97179"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we've defined a helper function, let's build our lists of sequences and labels:","metadata":{},"id":"5ad7e7fd"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sequences = []\nlabels = []\n\nfor row_idx, row in df.iterrows():\n    row_labels = build_labels(row[\"Sequence\"], row[\"Beta strand\"], row[\"Helix\"])\n    sequences.append(row[\"Sequence\"])\n    labels.append(row_labels)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"313811fe"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating our dataset","metadata":{},"id":"8e8b3ba8"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Nice!
