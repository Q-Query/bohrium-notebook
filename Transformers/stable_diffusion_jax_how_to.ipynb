In TPUs with sufficient memory, it could be larger than `1` if we wanted to generate multiple images (per chip) at once.\n\nWe are almost ready to generate images! We just need to create a random number generator to pass to the generation function. This is the standard procedure in Flax, which is very serious and opinionated about random numbers – all functions that deal with random numbers are expected to receive a generator. This ensures reproducibility, even when we are training across multiple distributed devices.\n\nThe helper function below uses a seed to initialize a random number generator.

It will also ensure that the model runs in parallel in the 8 available devices.\n\nThe first time we run the following cell it will take a long time to compile, but subequent calls (even with different inputs) will be much faster.

We'll now briefly look inside that process to show how it works.\n\nJAX parallelization can be done in multiple ways. The easiest one revolves around using the `jax.pmap` function to achieve single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) parallelization. It means we'll run several copies of the same code, each on different data inputs. More sophisticated approaches are possible, we invite you to go over the [JAX documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [`pjit` pages](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/08-pjit.html?highlight=pjit) to explore this topic if you are interested!\n\n`jax.pmap` does two things for us:\n- Compiles (or `jit`s) the code, as if we had invoked `jax.jit()`. This does not happen when we call `pmap`, but the first time the pmapped function is invoked.\n- Ensures the compiled code runs in parallel in all the available devices.\n\nTo show how it works we `pmap` the `_generate` method of the pipeline, which is the private method that runs generates images. Please, note that this method may be renamed or removed in future releases of `diffusers`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p_generate = pmap(pipeline._generate)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After we use `pmap`, the prepared function `p_generate` will conceptually do the following:\n* Invoke a copy of the underlying function `pipeline._generate` in each device.\n* Send each device a different portion of the input arguments. That's what sharding is used for. In our case, `prompt_ids` has shape `(8, 1, 77, 768)`. This array will be split in `8` and each copy of `_generate` will receive an input with shape `(1, 77, 768)`.\n\nWe can code `_generate` completely ignoring the fact that it will be invoked in parallel. We just care about our batch size (`1` in this example) and the dimensions that make sense for our code, and don't have to change anything to make it work in parallel.\n\nThe same way as when we used the pipeline call, the first time we run the following cell it will take a while, but then it will be much faster.\n\n```\n%%time\nimages = p_generate(prompt_ids, p_params, rng)\nimages = images.block_until_ready()\nimages.shape\n```\n\n```python out\nCPU times: user 1min 15s, sys: 18.2 s, total: 1min 34s\nWall time: 1min 15s\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"images.shape","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```python out\n(8, 1, 512, 512, 3)\n```\n\nWe use `block_until_ready()` to correctly measure inference time, because JAX uses asynchronous dispatch and returns control to the Python loop as soon as it can. You don't need to use that in your code; blocking will occur automatically when you want to use the result of a computation that has not yet been materialized.","metadata":{}}]}
