The models available allow for many different\nconfigurations and a great versatility in use-cases. The most simple ones are presented here, showcasing usage for\ntasks such as image classification, question answering, sequence classification, named entity recognition and others.\n\nThese examples leverage auto-models, which are classes that will instantiate a model according to a given checkpoint,\nautomatically selecting the correct model architecture. Please check the [AutoModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) documentation\nfor more information. Feel free to modify the code to be more specific and adapt it to your specific use-case.\n\nIn order for a model to perform well on a task, it must be loaded from a checkpoint corresponding to that task. These\ncheckpoints are usually pre-trained on a large corpus of data and fine-tuned on a specific task. This means the\nfollowing:\n\n- Not all models were fine-tuned on all tasks. If you want to fine-tune a model on a specific task, you can leverage\n  one of the *run_$TASK.py* scripts in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) directory.\n- Fine-tuned models were fine-tuned on a specific dataset. This dataset may or may not overlap with your use-case and\n  domain. As mentioned previously, you may leverage the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) scripts to fine-tune your model, or you may\n  create your own training script.\n\nIn order to do an inference on a task, several mechanisms are made available by the library:\n\n- Pipelines: very easy-to-use abstractions, which require as little as two lines of code.\n- Direct model use: Less abstractions, but more flexibility and power via a direct access to a tokenizer\n  (PyTorch/TensorFlow) and full inference capacity.\n\nBoth approaches are showcased here.\n\n<Tip>\n\nAll tasks presented here leverage pre-trained checkpoints that were fine-tuned on specific tasks. Loading a\ncheckpoint that was not fine-tuned on a specific task would load only the base transformer layers and not the\nadditional head that is used for the task, initializing the weights of that head randomly.\n\nThis would produce random output.\n\n</Tip>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sequence Classification","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sequence classification is the task of classifying sequences according to a given number of classes.
