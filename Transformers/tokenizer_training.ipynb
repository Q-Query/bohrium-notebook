This pipeline takes several steps:\n\n- **Normalization**: Executes all the initial transformations over the initial input string. For example when you need to lowercase some text, maybe strip it, or even apply one of the common unicode normalization process, you will add a Normalizer.\n- **Pre-tokenization**: In charge of splitting the initial input string. That's the component that decides where and how to pre-segment the origin string. The simplest example would be to simply split on spaces.\n- **Model**: Handles all the sub-token discovery and generation, this is the part that is trainable and really dependent of your input data.\n- **Post-Processing**: Provides advanced construction features to be compatible with some of the Transformers-based SoTA models. For instance, for BERT it would wrap the tokenized sentence around [CLS] and [SEP] tokens.\n\nAnd to go in the other direction:\n\n- **Decoding**: In charge of mapping back a tokenized input to the original string. The decoder is usually chosen according to the `PreTokenizer` we used previously.\n\nFor the training of the model, the ü§ó Tokenizers library provides a `Trainer` class that we will use.\n\nAll of these building blocks can be combined to create working tokenization pipelines. To give you some examples, we will show three full pipelines here: how to replicate GPT-2, BERT and T5 (which will give you an example of BPE, WordPiece and Unigram tokenizer).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### WordPiece model like BERT","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's have a look at how we can create a WordPiece tokenizer like the one used for training BERT.
