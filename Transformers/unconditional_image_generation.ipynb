The model only generates images - without any additional context like text or an image - resembling the training data it was trained on.\n\nThe [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/diffusion_pipeline#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) is the easiest way to use a pre-trained diffusion system for inference.\n\nStart by creating an instance of [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/diffusion_pipeline#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) and specify which pipeline checkpoint you would like to download.\nYou can use any of the 🧨 Diffusers [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) from the Hub (the checkpoint you'll use generates images of butterflies).\n\n<Tip>\n\n💡 Want to train your own unconditional image generation model?
